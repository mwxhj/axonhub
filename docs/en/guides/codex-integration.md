# Codex Integration Guide

---

## Overview
AxonHub can act as a drop-in replacement for OpenAI endpoints, letting Codex connect through your own infrastructure. This guide explains how to configure Codex and how to combine it with AxonHub model profiles for flexible routing.

### Key Points
- AxonHub performs AI protocol/format transformation. You can configure multiple upstream channels (providers) and expose a single OpenAI-compatible interface for Codex.
- You can aggregate Codex requests from the same conversation by enabling `server.trace.codex_trace_enabled` (uses `Session_id`) or adding extra headers via `server.trace.extra_trace_headers`.

### Prerequisites
- AxonHub instance reachable from your development machine.
- Valid AxonHub API key with project access.
- Access to Codex (OpenAI compatible) application.
- Optional: one or more model profiles configured in the AxonHub console.

### Configure Codex
1. Edit `${HOME}/.codex/config.toml` and register AxonHub as a provider:
   ```toml
   model = "gpt-5"
   model_provider = "axonhub-responses"

   [model_providers.axonhub-responses]
   name = "AxonHub using Chat Completions"
   base_url = "http://127.0.0.1:8090/v1"
   env_key = "AXONHUB_API_KEY"
   wire_api = "responses"
   query_params = {}
   ```
2. Export the API key for Codex to read:
   ```bash
   export AXONHUB_API_KEY="<your-axonhub-api-key>"
   ```
3. Restart Codex to apply the configuration.

#### Trace aggregation by conversation (important)
Enable the built-in Codex trace extraction to reuse the `Session_id` header as the trace ID:

```yaml
server:
  trace:
    codex_trace_enabled: true
```

If Codex sends a different stable conversation identifier header (for example `Conversation_id`), you can configure AxonHub to use it as a fallback trace header in `config.yml`:

```yaml
server:
  trace:
    extra_trace_headers:
      - Conversation_id
```

**Note**: Enabling this also ensures that requests from the same trace are prioritized to be sent to the same upstream channel, significantly improving provider-side cache hit rates (e.g., Anthropic Prompt Caching).

#### Testing
- Send a sample prompt; AxonHub's request logs should show a `/v1/chat/completions` call.
- Enable tracing in AxonHub to inspect prompts, responses, and latency.

### Working with Model Profiles
AxonHub model profiles remap incoming model names to provider-specific equivalents:
- Create a profile in the AxonHub console and add mapping rules (exact name or regex).
- Assign the profile to your API key.
- Switch active profiles to alter Codex behavior without changing tool settings.

      </a>
      <br/>
      Model Profiles

  </tr>
</table>

#### Example
- Request `gpt-4` → mapped to `deepseek-reasoner` for getting more accurate responses.
- Request `gpt-3.5-turbo` → mapped to `deepseek-chat` for reducing costs.

### Troubleshooting
- **Codex reports authentication errors**: ensure `AXONHUB_API_KEY` is exported in the same shell session that launches Codex.
- **Unexpected model responses**: review active profile mappings in the AxonHub console; disable or adjust rules if necessary.

## Provider Quota Tracking

AxonHub no longer maintains a separate Codex provider-quota polling subsystem.

If you need budgeting or routing control for Codex credentials, configure local credential quota on the credential itself. Routing treats upstream quota failures as normal request failures and relies on fallback behavior instead of a second quota product model.
